# Business Analysis with Python (Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Analytics, and Insights)

This project explores data analytics in the hospitality sector, focusing on a leading hotel group. The journey began with data cleaning to establish a solid foundation for analysis. Using feature engineering, key variables were created to reveal patterns and trends. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I investigated correlations, distributions, and anomalies, uncovering insights embedded in the data. The visualizations and statistical analyses provided actionable insights, transforming the hotel's raw data into valuable information that can drive strategic decision-making and future growth.
